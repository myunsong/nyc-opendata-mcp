# Legacy NYC Open Data Server

The original MCP server for 311, HPD, DOT, Events, and Comptroller data now lives here for reference only.
It is not wired into the current build, tests, or npm scripts. The active codebase for the building-focused
MCP server is in the repository root (`src/`, `dist/`).
